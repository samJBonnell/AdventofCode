2021:
My third run through the ringer has begun! We will see how long I can maintain the problem solving but the goal is to finish all problems by the 1st of January - I have not finished even a smidgen of the problems by January...

2022:
This year, the goal is to progress past day ten and hopefully start the new year with an AOC total of 20 stars for this years challenge! We shall see!
