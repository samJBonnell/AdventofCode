# AdventOfCode

2021:
My third run through the ringer has begun! We will see how long I can maintain the problem solving but the goal is to finish all problems by the 1st of January - I have not finished even a smidgen of the problems by January...

2022:
This year, the goal is to progress past day ten and hopefully start the new year with an AOC total of 20 stars for this years challenge! We shall see!

2023:
A slow year to begin with finals, capstone projects, etc. but I am looking forward to solving this years puzzles in C++!

2024:
First year in my Masters so we shall see how much time I can find, but ideally, I would like to move back into the 10-15 star range. I plan to continue writing in C++ BUT! we shall see if plain ole' C makes an appearance!

2025:
Setting stuff up earlier this year (second year in graduate school, yipee!) but I hope to just get through some problems, write in C++/C to improve my baseline programming skills, and who knows, maybe try again to get all the stars!
